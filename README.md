# Handwritten Digit Recognition using ANN

Handwritten digit recognition is a "hello world" problem for computer vision. In this repository, I have uploaded two example notebooks of how to build an ANN model and solve the handwritten digit recognition problem. One notebook demonstrate the process using PyTorch and the other uses TensorFlow. PyTorch and TensorFlow are two of the most used deep learning libraries.

This repository is created to provide example code for my next blog post about the basic understanding of Neural Network. The link to the blog post will be updated as soon as the post is published. I am currently working on it.

## Requirements

* Python 3
* Numpy
* Matplotlib

For running the Pytorch notebook,
* Pytorch
* TorchVision

For running the TensorFlow notebook,
* TensorFlow 2
* TensorFlow-datasets
* TensorFlow-hub
